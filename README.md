# SillyPythonGames
When i get bored i make silly terminal based games in python. Some aren't very exciting, but some are. I mainly use these for practice to be completely honest. If you want to use these to learn i highly encourage it.


List of games currently here:

- NumberGuess.py : This is a fairly boring game where you choose a number 1-100 and the computer trys to guess it.

- miniCollection.py : This is a collection of Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, and a pig dice game. It was my first actual program and is not very well programmed.
